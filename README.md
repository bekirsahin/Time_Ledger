# Time Ledger

A minimalist, one-screen time calculator for:
- Date-to-now countdown/elapsed time
- Time interval differences between two dates
- “If you did X every day…” time savings projections
- A simple countdown “time window” timer

## What it is (modules)
- **Date**
  - Enter a target date/time (past or future).
  - Shows elapsed/remaining time in a live clock + totals.
  - Quick buttons: Now / Next week / Next month / Next Monday / 1st Monday.

- **Time Interval**
  - Enter any two date/times (From → To).
  - Shows the difference (years/months/weeks/days + HH:MM:SS) and totals.
  - Swap button flips From/To.

- **Time Savings**
  - Uses the **Date** interval (now ↔ target).
  - Inputs: minutes/day, days/week, adherence (%).
  - Outputs: estimated time saved over that interval.

- **Time Window**
  - Countdown timer (e.g., fasting window, focus block).
  - Start / Pause / Reset, shows “ends at” time.

## Where you can use it (step-by-step ideas)
- **Planning a deadline**
  - Set a future target date → see exact time remaining.
  - Use Time Savings to estimate how much progress time you “bank” if you do a daily habit until that date.

- **Habit building (reading, study, practice)**
  - Pick an end date (exam, launch, trip).
  - Enter minutes/day + adherence % → see realistic total effort time.

- **Two-date comparisons**
  - Compare dates (e.g., project start vs. milestone date) with Time Interval.
  - Use it for scheduling, retrospective reviews, or estimating pace.

- **Work sprints / deep work**
  - Use Time Window for a 25/50/90-minute focus block.
  - Or a “no-phone” window, breaks, or study sessions.

- **Health windows (fasting / sleep routines)**
  - Set a 14–16 hour countdown (fasting window).
  - Use “ends at” to know when the window completes.

- **Travel / events**
  - Time remaining until flight, meeting, or appointment.
  - Time interval between two events (layovers, downtime).

## Benefits (why it’s useful)
- **One screen, no scrolling** → quick glance decisions.
- **Live time + totals** → both intuitive and precise.
- **Flexible for any habit** → minutes/day + adherence = realistic projection.
- **Timezone-aware per device** → works naturally for each user’s local time.
- **Minimal input friction (mobile-friendly)** → time fields accept digits like 1200 → 12:00.
- **Private & offline-friendly** → static HTML; no accounts, no tracking.
